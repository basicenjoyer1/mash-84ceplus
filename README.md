mash for the ti 84 
you probably can guess how to use it but if you need the rundown: 


mash2 instructions:
1. input how many categories you would like to have
2. name the categories
3. see results! simple as that!

mash was my attempt at a simple mash-type game using strings that extend past 0-9. I don't currently own a "cracked" calculator that can run these. 
download it and let me know if it works. send me the edited code if you have any ideas on how to fix it for the non-cracked ti calculator.
